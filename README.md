# GarbageProfilingApp

The project was developed as a part of a competition in a team of 4. The problem statement of competition required to develop a system which gives rating to communities based on waste segregation and plastic usage which could later be used by civic bodies. I was responsible for architecting the whole system and data flow. I also developed the backend and also worked with android team. The main technologies used in project are deep learning, flask, python, firebase, android, REST etc.
