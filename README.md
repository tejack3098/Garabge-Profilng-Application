The problem of poor sanitation and waste management is a critical issue facing many of India's cities, with the current state of cleanliness falling far short of the desired standard. To address this challenge, the government and city corporations have implemented directives aimed at improving waste segregation, reducing plastic usage, and ensuring that waste is disposed of properly. However, the reality on the ground still lags behind the desired standards, and many city areas are performing poorly in waste management.

To help address this issue, our team of 3 members undertook a project to develop a mobile application that could be used to capture images of garbage at local collection points and analyze them to rate communities based on waste segregation and plastic usage. To achieve this, we used Java, Python, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to develop an Android app with an accuracy rate of 86%.

The app aims to solve problems faced by civic bodies and identify underperforming regions to organize more awareness campaigns. It offers a reliable, technology-driven approach to garbage profiling, which can provide a more accurate assessment of waste segregation and plastic usage than manual inspection. By capturing images of garbage at collection points, the app can provide valuable insights into the state of waste management and sanitation in different areas, helping to guide decision-making and policy formulation.

Overall, our project represents an innovative and effective solution to the problem of poor sanitation and waste management in India's cities. By leveraging the power of technology, we have created a tool that can help improve waste management, promote public wellbeing, and support the government's objective of providing complete sanitation solutions for all of India's statutory towns.
